## Description
**Red Wine Quality Classification**

In this analysis of the work, it will be determined which physiochemical properties make red wine 'good!' by using some machine learning techniques. Content of the paper is starting with introduction of the data set, and some data visualization. Then some classification and one regression technique will be applied to the data and with cross validation accuracy will be evaluated. Lastly, the best estimator will be decided according to cross validation score and conculusion.

1. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).

2.Decision Tree

Decision trees use multiple algorithms to decide to split a node into two or more sub-nodes. The creation of sub-nodes increases the homogeneity of resultant sub-nodes. ... The decision tree splits the nodes on all available variables and then selects the split which results in most homogeneous sub-nodes.

3. Random Forest

Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object
