## Description
**Multiple Linear Regression**

Multiple Linear Regression is basically indicating that we will be having many features Such as f1, f2, f3, f4, and our output feature f5.
Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable
