## Description
**Simple linear regression**  is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables.
-   One variable, denoted  _x_, is regarded as the  **predictor**,  **explanatory**, or  **independent**  variable.
-   The other variable, denoted  _y_, is regarded as the  **response**,  **outcome**, or  **dependent**  variable.

**What is a simple linear regression model?**

-Simple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line. Both variables should be quantitative.

-Linear regression most often uses mean-square error (MSE) to calculate the error of the mode
